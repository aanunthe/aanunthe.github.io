            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! Iâ€™m Anand Singh, a passionate software engineer and web developer with a knack for creating efficient and scalable applications. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas, I specialize in Machine Learning, Web Development, and Mobile Application Development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional experience includes an internship at Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Full-Stack Engineer, where I led a team to develop a user verification portal for a ride-sharing platform. Additionally, I interned at Steel Authority of India Limited, developing a Flutter-based employee contact directory with real-time data synchronization.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also an avid contributor to my academic community. During my undergraduate studies at Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, I coordinated the Innogeeks club, promoting peer-to-peer learning in various technical domains. I am also an active sports enthusiast and served as a defender in my university's soccer club.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to leverage my technical skills and leadership abilities to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. In my free time, I enjoy coding new projects, playing soccer, and exploring advancements in AI and machine learning.
